my my, did things go off kilter! i finished watching the entire first season,
the 13 episodes available, and i have a lot to complain about. but first, the
good.

the action sequences are good. the story does not become boring. the stakes
always appear to be high (although, it is not really the case---more on that
later) and that makes it pausing hard. 
i also like how noble the noble lords are. rael's brother slashing himself when
rael interrupts the fight and distracts frankenstein so he gets injured is one
example of something i liked. just honorable fighting.

the problems come in plenty as well.
1. whatever happened to M21 trying to figure out the names of his comrades?
   whatever happened of his promise? has that line been abandoned after tao was
   unable to find anything?
2. M21's werewolf powers were no alluded to again.
3. frankenstein... did we need another mystery to be interjected? frankenstein
   is a lot of fun to watch. but we don't know how he got all those powers? what
   was the point of the backstory if it had to be left open?
4. more on stakes: the tensions are ultimately artificial. raizel can just come
   in at any time and overpower everybody with his blood storm. even the
   lordlady who was being propped up as the ultimate boss did little against
   raizel. no matter what happens elsewhere, raizel stands up and everythign
   stops.
5. no major deaths.
6. only the smaller nobles die. and there are no consequences for that. raizel
   knights come in and kill when regis is trying to force something smoother,
   and then, nothing happens. the nobles overpower but do not kill.
7. why did raizel go into this 820 year long sleep?
8. how did frankenstein find him? (i guess in order to find these answers, i
   will need to watch the ova. but this is season 1 for crying out loud.
   shouldn't this be the start?)
9. kase and yosuke are total background characters in the second half.
10. the union. whatever they are? no explanation at all.

looks like this was a season set up with the assumption of a sequel. there was
no attempt at all to tie ends. only 1 end was tied, and that's the proving of
innocence of raizel. but did that need 820 years. couldn't the nobles have
discovered the coffin earlier? (btw, this finding the coffin was a total DIO
ripoff. not that i have a problem with that.)


* <2021-01-05 Tue> Simulating Society Ch5.
# copyright (c) 2021 yumemirohito. [[* <2020-12-14 Mon> KPL.][KPLv1.0]] affirmed for this section.
i just went over chapter5 of gaylord's simulating society. checking with
neighbors and deciding whether to conform or do something else. similar to what
i was trying to with the netlogo code from last month. i sense a paper here.
preference falsification. until neighbors behave a certain way, conform even if
it implies falsification of personal preference. what would i be studying in the
paper though? financial needs and preference falsification. need something to
emerge. game theory behind courage. the predictions that would follow if a
society is filled with yes-men.

some very well choregraphed fight scenes took place in eps3-6. m-21 got
discovered by cranz's team. he held on for a while but was clearly outmached.
regis interfered. m21 did not realized the full power of regis, and interfered
back, putting himself between shark and regis.

so m21 is captured and interrogated. he does not buckle, and instead tries to
find out information about his comrades. i like how he is the main main
character so far, but he is not the strongest, and also not the most prominent.
regis turns out to be stronger. he did say that the nobles have become weaker,
however, regis and seira are plenty strong.

the show does a good job of characterizing a number of the antagonists. tao and
tekio for ex, it is hard to watch them get killed. shark had no redeeming
qualities. so the show does put a character like that in, one who is a true
villain. and then there's cranz, man with a mission, but willing to do anything
to advance his position. i would really have liked him to not betray the
character that was getting built up for him. i would have liked to see him flee
with his comrades once raizel came into the scene and demonstrated his
abilities. that would have shown more character complexity.

hammer reminded me of gary from the white tigers in beyblade. but this fat guy
actually showed some prudence. in some ways he reminds me of choji form naruto
too. but evil. just quietly fluffing around in the background, caring about
nothing but food, but then regis comes in to land a decisive blow on shark, and
at the last moment, he intervnes, throwing his explosives at regis. then he
advises shark to take him seriously. and when even after the power up shark has
trouble dealing with regis, hammer brings yosuke and kase down, and forces regis
to stand down. 

seira has quite a likeable character. she had been holding back far more than
her counterpart, however, when she realized regis was in danger, she finally
showed her power. she held her own against hammer, or well, hammer was able to
hold his own against seira. but then she pulled out her scithe, and it was gg.

frankenstein was quite something as well. he unleashed his power when teiko
muttered something about dealing with his master. that was a great scene to
watch. no response to him saying he was going to kill frankenstein. but deal
with the kid? no fucking way! but the show had humanized teiko so much so far,
it was going to be painful to watch him die. fortunately, seira showed up at
this moment, and teiko pleaded to seira to send his apologies to yosuke for
dragging him into this matter. seira also asked frankenstein if he was planning
to kill teiko---this makes me feel she did not kill hammer. frankenstein is
interesting.

the real star of the last episode, however, was raizel. he was at a completely
different power level. mind control, some bloodbending like ability. and he's
started to talk a little more. he showed m21 some of the werewolf like powers he
possesses. this is going to be quite fun to watch.

the core of these episodes was to let raizel have the opportunity to shine.
which he did. 

ep7 was a filler for the most part. it was quite fun watching raizel ordering
everyone to help yosuke find a way to express his infatuation with seira. what i
disliked was how kase and yosuke's memories were wiped. it is a bit like using a
time machine to undo events, or a bit like having seemingly consequential things
happen in a dream. it will be interesting to see how this plays out. it would
have been interesting to see what would have happened if yousuke did not agree
to their memories being rewritten. would the noblesse have forced the rewrite
anyway, citing security concerns? and now that the rewriting has taken place, it
will be intersting to see what residual consequences this has. i am reminded of
julia from book2 of the magicians.

* <2021-01-05 Tue> Lowlights: The Mundane Aspects Of Life In Pointfeather.
Copyright (C) 2021 alanwespen. 
LIA age 11.
the storm would hit in an hour. one would be wise to disconnect all wired
connections before it hit. lia checked every gadget. the satellite was
disconnected. the tv was disconnected. the lights were on, and lia sat in her
room with her mother anticipating the power to go and plunge the room into
darkness.

she did not want to be alone with her mother in the dark. the emergency lights
were ready to be deployed. she carried her torch everywhere she went. and with
them she carried extra batteries. 

lia looked around the room. she looked at her shelves. the rows of storybooks,
rare out of print editions of the Nancy Wade collection, and the Peter Holland
collection. renlin had borrowed at least half of them. marco was not into such
books, his interests were elsewhere. the biographies and the histories. lia had
read all the books of course, even those she could not fully understand, because
there were multiple meanings of the words described, and her mother could not
help her figure out what was the correct interpretations, and her father was not
here. she discussed the stories with the boys, but mostly renlin because he
showed real interest. but that was it. they both got stuck somewhere.

and then there was this Sparron Omnibus. every time they would open the book,
new footnotes would come to the front. it was as if the book was judging you,
figuring out what you understood, how much you understood, and then presenting
further information that might enhance your understanding. how could i miss
something like this in the first read? lia often wondered. but then she
realized. of course, i was not ready to see it. the book had a life of its own.
the marginalia left behind by the previous owners, all capable of being hidden
or illuminated by the utterance of a spell. 

when the lightning struck, the power went out. lia lit the torch and put it in
an upturned glass jar. and then she went to hug her mother.

the mother smiled. her teeth glined as rays of light deflected from the glass
jar hit them. the expression was unchanging. she was made of wood. she wore 
woollen clothes that were warm to touch. lia squeezed her. lia missed her. 

* <2021-01-04 Mon> Thoughts On The Continuation Of Pointfeather.
alanwespen.
It has been 2.5 years since I started the project. It should have been done by
now. At this rate, another 2.5 years will pass with nothing out worthy of being
published. What should I do?

I think other books are distracting. I cannot get adequately excited about them.
Also, there is no guarantee that over time, I will face the same kind of problem
with them too. And then I will have 2 big unfinished projects. 

The tasks ahead should be the following. Go through what has been written (in
the print) and figure out what can be kept. Introduce all the characters. Write
out the backgrounds and capabilities and peculiarities of the a large cast of
characters and then allow them to interact. Running out of ideas has never been
a problem. You have the plot. But executing it is the problem.

Get to know the characters better. Marco. Find more about him. Write his
biography. Erasmus. Renlin. Lia. Magnus. Ireen. Charl. Marina. Ajax. The final
class characters. Know more about all of them. That should be the project to do
for a month. Write up their backstories. Write up their details: likes,
dislikes, fashion choices, spell preference. 

Thoughts On Wands. Wands are tools. Humans need tools. Better tools, better
outcomes. Humans do not get better when tools are taken away from them.
(counterexample abacus) So taking a wand away should not make sorcerers better.
The magicians who follow the ancient code are able to form specialized spelling
objects, and the object can be anything. Tools that enable representation are
complementary (abacus). Tools that generate output are supplementary
(calculator). Use this fact to rewrite some of the stories. This provides good
justification for an explosion of magical objects. Note, better representation
allows for better use of the tools involved.

I also have this idea about professors emiriti. Disembodied heads in floating
cylinders maintained by universities.

Think about the economics of magical education. Think about the politics of it too. 
Olarc is ultimately a small college attached to the side. No graduate students,
not a whole lot of funding and prestige. But this is still a significant place. 

* <2021-01-04 Mon> Games and Economic Behavior.
alanwespen.
The [[https://www.journals.elsevier.com/games-and-economic-behavior][Games and Economic Behavior]] journal is free to publish in, as per
information presented in [[https://kochiuyu.github.io/others/journalfee][Chiu Yu Ko's github page]]. I am considering working on
my paper about incentives, preference falsification, and groupthink. Having the
goal to publish in a proper journal, is going to have a proper motivating effect. 

So what might this paper be about. Another big round of thinking to follow.
Perhaps I should postpone this until after the apps are completed. I will have
to combine this with ABM. This will happen after I have gone through the Richard
Gaylord book about simulating societies. And then as data I could look for
surveys, and everything I can get my hold on, from the information available on
the fall of soviet countries. I don't know the details. This is just throwing
ideas out. 

* <2021-01-04 Mon> Practically Beautiful Format.
# alanwespen. [[Kakashi Public License v1.0]] affirmed for this section.
I'm renaming what was previously known as "13 Rules Of Beauiful Writing" to
"Practically Beautiful Format" or pbf. It sounds like pdf or pbs, but is
neither. PBF has the advantage of not having a number attached to its name.
Also, the name is descriptive, the goal is achieving practical beauty.

Note, 13 Saints are, until further notice, asked to abstain from beginning a
sentence in lowercase. Let some of the social restrictions relax, and then we
shall resume with what is practical. The rest of the rules stand.

i've been very intrigued by the first couple of episodes of noblesse. ep1
introduces some of the main characters. it introduces the threat posed by one
bloody gang. three likeable characters are introduced: the director, the guard,
and the redhead. three plotlines, at least, are going on: the guard, the
modified human as we learn he is from ep2, is trying to stay low; the director,
who's just been placed in that role, is trying to serve his master who's woken
up from a long sleep (this master is so far in the background, but the cover art
has him front and center, so i am guessing he is going to play a major major
role in the future. 

ep2 provides more character development and background. we learn that the guard
is a modified human, a Wolverine like figure---totally going on board with the
x-men trope, which explains why he is able to hold his own against superhuman
creatures. 

the bullies show up again. they don't need character development. they serve
two purposes: show how strong the guard is, and how good the redhead is.

we learn a little about a mcguffin: the missing coffin. this gives some DIO
vibes. 

we have the entry of 2 new characters: nobles as they are called. it will be
interesting to see what they are up to. apparently they have come to investigate
what happened in the previous month, in which the guard defended those he was in
charge of looking after. i think these two nobles, although they have a vampiric
essence, are good. they are clearly powerful. don't know about the girl, but the
boy sure is powerful. there is some foreshadowing about the destruction they
might bring in wanting to do good. interesting. i will be watching.

characters: guard M-21, raizel, regis, seira, frankenstein, yusuke.

predictions. yusuke will grow into something powerful. he is not superhuman, but
he is able to hold his own against multiple bullies. 

raizel is the master here, but he has been in the background so far. he has not
shown his powers yet, however, through his looks he is able to get M-21 to take
actions. M-21 clearly has high regards for him. Raizel has shown no resistance
so far to whatever the humans have wanted. They want to play with him, he says
yes. Yosuke recommends that Regis and Seira stay at the director's place, he
says yes. The day he says no, it will be something to watch.  

Think of this as a prologue and two chapters so far. Multiple named characters
have been introduced already, and the plot is getting complicated. In a good
way. About 12 named characters already. 

Comments on the structure: Prologue: fights and survivors. high school tropes
girls hot guy hot guard. destruction, likeable cast. injured protagonist. The
main tension of ep1 was to show M-21 struggle with balancing staying low and
protecting the children. The punch came with him intervening to stop the
bullies. The tension for ep2 revolved around the guard trying to figure out what
was going on with the introduction of the two nobles Regis and Seira. M-21 shows
his loyalty for humans in his conversations with the nobles. Regis followed M-21
to ask him information about the attack. It seems all Regis is trying to do is
get information that will help him protect humans. Upon confirming that M-21 is
not a weak human, but rather a modified human, a human-monster, Regis unleashed
(some) of his power. Here, the bullies attacking the others helped force unity
of direction for Regis and M-21 who immediately went to attend the situation.
The Regis vs M-21 battle had to be the locus for this episode; the rest of the
episode was built around that. However, it did not end with a decisive punch.
They did not fight it all out. Instead they went to face the bullies. Notice, at
any moment, they were strong enough to kill the bullies off, but the tension in
this scene comes from the necessity to engage to the minimum necessary extent.
Lucky for them, there is a normal human in Yosuke who is there capable enough to
handle the necessary. Some backstory, some character development, some plot
advancement: the episode did fine.    

* <2021-01-04> Minimum Necessary Successes Criterion.
Copyright (C) 2021 bald eagle.
i was thinking about the minimum necessary successes criterion this morning. this
is quite a useful principle to bear in mind. when setting a goal to achieve, ask
how many successes are required. good goals require the fewest number of successes. 
think of writing a poem. you can have hundreds of sets of crappy lines. but you
need to hit the right combination once. then you have a poem. success.
on the other hand, think of a song performance. you must nail it every single time.
you fail once, and that's it. 

this does not need to be extreme. take nanowrimo. 1667 words 30 times in a row and
you win. to win, you must succeed daily. how about modifying it? 10k words any 5
days, and that's 50k. 5 successes and a win. which is easier: succeeding every day,
or succeeding 5 times? perhaps more modification is needed. how about 5k 10 times?
even that should be easier than coming up with 1667 words 30 times in a row.

* <2021-01-04 Mon> Why GENERAL.org?
<<Readme>> by baldeagle. # [[Kakashi Public License v1.0]] affirmed for this section.
i have a habit of writing things up in different files: a new idea comes up and
a new file comes into existence. after a while i end up with too many discrete
disjointed files that become difficult to handle. 

when i write up different files, they get arranged according to last modified
date and other criteria. sure sort them chronologically if you want to see them
chronologically, but that's not terribly convenient.

i tried using social media platforms to keep a chronological record. but fuck
them. there are character limits. i cannot upload files. total mess. and if
that's not enough, you never know when they shut down and your data is lost.

therefore, general.org. ideas germinate here. if they get to a certain size,
they get their separate file, a file that is linked to this document. if updates
are made to that document, snippets of the updates may be found here along with
a link to the document. and there, just by searching the words pasted here, one
can arrive at the necessary spot.

think of this as a social media feed. with no technical limit and full control.

-* thoughts.
the setting is the 80s. anytime during the decade of the 80s is allowed, and
jumping back and forth is allowed, though discouraged. computers are beginning
to make their mark. people have a hard time making use of these computers.
seeing how far we have come with computer technology in the last few decades, it
is not difficult to imagine that there would be very sophisticated chips inside
our brains in a few deacdes. the way we are alienated from the older,
technologically incapable generation because of our use of computers,
smartphones, and the internet, the next generation is going to be alienated from
us, because they will not know a life without a computer embedded in their
brains. but that is not the focus here. the focus here is on the bygone tech
that brings with it a sense of nostalgia for the times when those who understood
such things understood all or most of it. 

a group of hackers (this is a late-teenage bunch of boys) are tinkering with all
the computers they can get a hold of. they are assisted by the older folk who
have invented the technology. but already, the software game is attempting to
take a life of its own with these younger kids.

the hackers are in mostly for fun. they are not called hackers yet, because they
have not broken into anything. everything is open, anyone can get in without the
need to break anything. they just need to know what to do. 

first for fun, and then for competition, one by one, they get into several of the
computers in town. and then they begin discovering stuff.
1. bank records. there were people who thought it would be great to keep bank
   records in an unencrypted form in their computers. aside: it would be
   interesting to study about how banking moved from all paperwork and metals to
   bits in the digital space, the History Of Banking---From Metals To Bits. 
2. personal diaries. this includes inner thoughts about medical records and sex
   life. 
3. advanced private projects. these could now be stolen and passed on as the
   personal projects and advancements of the hackers, who also could set up
   systems to monetize these works.

not every machine was connected to the internet at this time. so how did the
hackers manage to get a hold of such stuff?
1. viruses. media devices could come with malware designed to copy everything,
   or key-log everything typed henceforth. this stored information would not
   have been able to go out into the world on their own. the user would help
   out. say he got a disk to view a movie or play a game, the disk remained
   installed and did its malware stuff in the background and stored the
   information, as much as possible, into the internal disk storage. when the
   user returned the disk (which had been rented) he returned a copy of the files
   in his computer too. 
2. interet cables would be needed for certain tasks. when somebody plugged his
   machine to the internet and visited certain sites, it would download malware
   into his machine, that would perform actions similar to those descibed above.
   then it would send the information through the wires.
3. and finally, there were some computers that were plugged in all the time.
   these could be hacked into by the hackers whenever they chose.

over the course of their hacking, they get into trouble. there are white hat
hackers who are after them. they had hacked into something serious, and now
there were magical forces out there trying to kill them.

:PROLOGUE: a hacker, a top student, watching an ascii art of a nude girl. the
closer he monitors her, the more aware he becomes of the fact that this is a
girl he knows. this is a literature teacher from high school, who had come as a
substitute teacher for a month, when the teacher was pregnant. she'd been
assigned to middle-grade classes after that. but the hacker admired her from a
distance. // the hacker gets further from the screen and is able to view the
shades of her body. he wants to see the breasts from up close, but when he gets
close, the details of the text show, and he is unable to enjoy the
representation. the hacker runs a few more lines of code and the art becomes
denser. he does this a few more times, and the resemblance becomes more stark.
and then HE MAKES A TYPO IN HIS COMMAND and hits return. the characters in the
screen begin to move, instead of an error return. the crush flaunts herself.
texts begin to appear on the screen. the hacker is confused, but assumes this is
the work of a very advanced coder. he would figure out how to write a program
that did this, but for now, he would play the game out. he confesses his
infatuation with the teacher. and the moment he does so, he's becomes an array
of ascii characters that get swept into the media device, and the media device
enters the cpu and he's in the screen with his crush naked. :/PROLOGUE:

this guy is back in the real world. the teacher had warned him about these
magical creatures but he thought this was a dream. but the dream stayed, and he
went on to write a code that "gave life to ascii art". 

one of the hackers had hacked into a repository of magical information. ++remeber
this town is a crater town. crater physics apply.++ magical elements get out of
hand during thunderstorms. all wired connections are requested to be
disconnected. otherwise the magical creatures can travel through the wires and
attack civilians. 

don't think too far ahead. plot-dead-ends have never been your problem. just
write up what you've got so far.

* <2021-01-04 Mon> 13 Rules Of Beautiful Writing.
# [[Kakashi Public License v1.0]] applies to this section.
one of the essential features of good writing is consistent style. No
Consistency = No Substance. when you write something, it is your duty to make
the content appear to be of high quality. the following are a list of guidelines
to be followed to help you out. these guidelines are lovingly called the
13rulesofbeautifulwriting, although there may not be literally 13 of them.

(1) use numbers wherever you can. the wise order of the ancient Hindoos created
0 as we know it, and thus gave us the modern number system. drop the inane Roman
numerals; whenever you need numbers use the Gift of the Hindoos ( 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 ) to create the meaning you need. style guides say you cannot begin with a
numeral after a period. well, that is totally arbitrary; it does not make the
text more beautiful, but it does make the writing difficult. corollary: using
ordinals such as 1st, 7th, etc is also encouraged.

# Notice Their Jawlines

Look at the pictures of these women from olden times:

[...and many more](https://freeclassicimages.com/VictorianLadies.html)

Women with wide jawlines seem to have been common back then. These women appear not only in regular images, but also in fashion magazines and so on. Angular jawlines are difficult to find.

This is evidence for the claim that the average jawline has shrunk in the last hundred years because of the soft, processed food we eat.

# Mathematica Diary

_Dec15. I'm beginning to understand how the lattice models work. Mathematica discourages object oriented programming, so I was having a hard time figuring out how to handle matters without resorting to inheritance and stuff. But the way to deal with it through Modules and stuff is straightforward enough. 

_Dec19.  I was able to replicate the results presented by the code in chapter 1. RasterArray and GraphicsArray have been deprecated, but wolfram auto-translates them into what is required. 100x100 grid for 10000 iterations takes about 16 minutes to compute (using Nest instead of NestList, which takes forever). 

![comp10k](C:\Users\Cystennin\Desktop\scriptresults\comp10k.png)

![ch1](/outputs/ch1.png)

MapThread is an important concept. I don't know how to put it in words. Think the following: you have a command that requires multiple arguments; each argument can be obtained through a simple translation of the current state. You layer these translations one on top of the other. MapThread takes each element of the base layer, and strings it together with the element right on top of it, and then the element on top of that, and so on until arrival at the element on the topmost layer. Each string now contains the arguments necessary to execute the command. 

* <2020-12-13> Wolfram Mathematica Is Awesome.
Wolfram Mathematica has been a major addition to my life this year. Python used to be my go-to language, but now with free license for Mathematica on offer, it's not the case anymore. I enjoy using Mathematica for a number of reasons. Here are some of them.

- Syntax that's closer to what mathematicians use. Compare `ppois(q, lambda, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)` in R to `CDF[PoissonDistribution[lambda], k]` in Mathematica. The Mathematica code is concise and better readable.
- Wolfram Knowledgebase.
- Thousands of built-in functions.

* <2020-12-13> Peter Hitchens And Drugs.
Christopher Hitchens said something along the following lines: The truth doesn't lie, but when it does lie, it lies somewhere in the middle. Hitch was a chainsmoker and his alcohol tolerance was the stuff of legends. In December 2011, at age 62, he fell to pneumonia while undergoing treatment for oesophagal cancer. 

Christopher's brother, Peter Hitchens, debates drug policy [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDtIZZiySgA][here]]. He argues that preventing addictive behavior is a matter of willpower and that strict penalties ought to be applied on drug offenders for deterrance. The opposition argues that the genetic component to addiction cannot be ignored and that drug courts in conjunction with therapy should lead the way instead. 

Late Hitch's quote came to my mind. Both sides are correct to a degree, and different people need to hear different presentations. Policymakers need to consider the second argument. They look ways to help nonviolent drug offenders out; it is a bit much to have someone put behind bars when all he did was engage in a private act of consuming a prohibited substance without negative externalities, let alone the matter of personal liberty. Portugal should be a required case study. On the other hand, individuals, regardless of whether the second argument is true, must act as though the first is true and exercise personal control, only seeking medical respite when behavioral modifications fail.

Peter Hitchens got under my skin a bit. On the one hand he supports drug ciminalization, but on the other hand he argues mask mandates are a draconian erosion of liberty. 
  
* <2020-12-12> Polar 2.0 is worse than Polar 1.0.
I was really beginning to enjoy using Polar Bookshelf. The 350MB cloud cap was not enough for me---my documents offline already exceeded 500MB---but I did not mind using the program offline. There was a `.polar` folder I needed to maintain a backup of. The promise was that I could simply physically transfer the folder to a different computer, install Polar, and get on with my business. 

I could highlight my documents with various colors. I could comment on the side. The pagemarking system was a little clunky to implement, but it was still the best kind of pagemarking I had seen. Tagging worked well enough. The progress bars were a nice touch. It worked.

I had just over a hundred documents. This worked better than simply having a folder full of PDF files. I was beginning to become deeply aware of what I was assimilating from digital documents, something I was sorely missing from the days of widespread use of physical codices. 

But Polar 2.0 does away with the offline system. Everything is on the cloud. I cannot open my document without internet access---that is a MAJOR drawback. I spend data downloading files. I spend data uploading them to Polar (something I don't see the benefit of.) It is slow. It inverts colors on PDF files by default turning pictures into monstrosities. The word "bookshelf" has been dropped off the name. The new icon evokes no association. There's no directory containing actual files. 

It does what I don't need. It skips what I do need. What the hell am I supposed to do with this demonstrably inferior product?
